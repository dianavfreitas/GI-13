The Movie Similarity Finder application allows users to search for movies and display a list of movies similar to the one entered. Users can select a movie from the search results and view a list of movies that share similarities with the selected movie. The application uses the TMDB API to fetch movie data. To use the application, users need to obtain an API key from TMDB and configure the application with this key. The project includes server-side code to handle API requests and serve the HTML interface, along with client-side code to display movie data and handle user interactions.
